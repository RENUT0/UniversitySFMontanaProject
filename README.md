# Starship Fontana #

This is an example C++ application using the SDL library.
It tries to be as nicely C++11 as possible but do keep in
mind that SDL is written in C and, at some stage, you have
to interface with it.

## Story ##
The evil space oranges have taken the holy bit-coint
Get it back

## Installation ##
You will have to have the SDL development libraries installed on
your system.

Use "chmod +x compile.sh" to enable the shell script

Then use "./compile.sh" to run the shell script which will:

run g++ commands and auto run the game
 
from the top-level directory.  The game will expect to find the
`assets` directory under its current working directory.
